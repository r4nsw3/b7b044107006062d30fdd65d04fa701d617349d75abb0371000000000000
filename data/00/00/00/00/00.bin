  |   CASTLE OF HEART, available exclusively for Nintendo Switch, is a      |
  |   classic action platformer at the genre's best... and most             |
  |   challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience.   |
  |   The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by     |
  |   the evil sorcerer's spell, but ready to prove that love and courage   |
  |   can conquer even the darkest magic.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village     |
  |   to the dark ruler's castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct     |
  |   environments - full of enemies who require different strategies to    |
  |   face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate   |
  |   to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of               |
  |   progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming          |
  |   grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will      |
  |   help him in his quest. But remember - the body of stone has its       |
  |   limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the          |
  |   energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if     |
  |   the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms   |
  |   and the ability to wield additional weapons with it.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Castle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with        |
  |   changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The      |
  |   game's aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the     |
  |   Slavic mythology - with some locations derived straight from          |
  |   famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers' home country    |
  |   - and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer       |
  |   titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle     |
  |   of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach,     |
  |   utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch features, which will        |
  |   enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.                         |
